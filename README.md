Hello Flattitude People!

Welcome to flattiserver (no capital letters anywhere). This server is build in a REST API structure and connected to a maravellous MySQL database.

Now it will be really complicated to access to the DB, because it requires an SSH tunnel connection with some private keys that I only have.

So, if you want to access the DB, please contact me at guillemon13@gmail.com

The WebService is free to use, but... please, do not run 3Million requests (DDoS Attacks).

Now the serious part:

WebService URL: http://flattiserver-flattitude.rhcloud.com/flattiserver

The service works as a common REST API, you know!

Best regards,
GR.
